merbful_authentication
=================

This is a port of the rails plugin "restful_authentication" by Rick Olson to the Merb Web Framework.

It is currently very freshly ported.  Please report any bugs / patches to 
has.sox /at/ gmail /dot/ com

You can find the original at http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/restful_authentication/

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user sessions \
		--include-activation
		
The first parameter specifies the model that gets created in signup
(typically a user or account model).  A model with migration is 
created (if migrations are available), as well as a basic controller with the create method.

The second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is
the controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the 
site.

The third parameter (--include-activation) generates the code for a 
ActionMailer and its respective Activation Code through email.

===  Currently supported ORMs
Active Record
Datamapper

=== Required Routes

At the moment this version of the plugin requires some named routes
    
    In config/router.rb
    
      r.resources :users
      r.match("/login").to(:controller => "Sessions", :action => "create").name(:login)
      r.match("/logout").to(:controller => "Sessions", :action => "destroy").name(:logout)
      r.match("/users/activate/:activation_code").to(:controller => "Users", :action => "activate").name(:user_activation)


Note:  
  When using activation don't forget to setup your mailer.
